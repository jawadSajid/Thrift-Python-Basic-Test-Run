# Thrift-Python-Basic-Test-Run
This architecture programmed in Python allows messages to be transferred from client to server and vice versa. Note that the transport instance of TSocket.TSocket in client.py should have the IP adress of the server machine which is defined in server codes transport instances of TSocket.TServerSocket. Port numbers should match too in client and server codes.
